# Market_Matching
Great Wolf Resorts wants to find the optimal pricing for its burgers. For this reason, its management is interested in running a test on their burger prices and has expressed interest in knowing what test plan we would recommend for them. We have sales information by item (burger vs pizza), meal time, date, and property. In addition, there are some other data related to how busy the park was, number of occupied rooms, number of adults and number of children.

a.) In the first one, we’re going to do a simple paired test where one group will receive the current pricing and the other group will receive the increased burger price for a fixed period of time. Select balanced test and control groups; you have flexibility to choose the response variable, the level of date aggregation (monthly, weekly, daily), the time frame (some resorts don't have a full year of data), the amount of dynamic time warping, the number of resorts that are paired, whether you output the suggested splits or choose based on other r output related to the analysis

b.)In the second one, we’re going to do the entire test within just one property. We will have four different burger pricing levels (+$0.0 – control, +$0.25, +$0.50, +$.75) across two different mealtimes (lunch/dinner) and two different times of the week (weekday/weekend).
Weekday = Mon-Thurs and Weekend = Fri-Sun

Research question, test idea, response variable, factors (and their levels), and hypothesis
Discussion of methodology, including sample selection, test design, and operationalization
Explanation and visualization of test assignment/randomization. For the first scenario, include a table and line graph comparing the test and control groups on the response variable.
Power and sample size estimation
1st scenario: Given the sample size (number of pairings) that you determine from your matching, what is the power of this test, assuming 95% confidence and our ability to detect a 10% increase in the response variable. Show all of the inputs to your calculation.
You will have to look at average monthly sales for each of the test and control groups to estimate the average difference and paired standard deviation
2nd scenario: Minimum needed sample size, along with assumptions/inputs
You can choose the effect size: .1 = small, .25 = medium
Divide the sample size by the number of treatments to find replicates per cell
If we have three replicates per treatment per week, how long would it take to run this test?
